# RecallBot - AI Memory Assistant
## Project Report

### 1. Project Overview
RecallBot is an intelligent chatbot that combines the power of AI with memory capabilities to provide context-aware conversations. It uses the Gemini AI model for natural language processing and Mem0 for memory management, creating a seamless experience for users to interact with an AI that remembers past conversations.

### 2. Technical Architecture

#### 2.1 Core Components
- **AI Engine**: Powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- **Memory System**: Utilizes Mem0 for persistent memory storage
- **Environment Management**: Uses python-dotenv for secure API key management
- **User Interface**: Command-line interface with markdown formatting

#### 2.2 Key Features
- Contextual memory retrieval
- Persistent conversation history
- User-specific memory storage
- Real-time AI responses
- Duplicate memory prevention
- Markdown-formatted output

### 3. Implementation Details

#### 3.1 Memory Management
```python
# Memory handling with duplicate prevention
processed_memories = set()
relevant_mem = mem_client.search(user_input, user_id=user_id)
if mem['memory'] not in processed_memories:
    message.append({'role':'user', 'content':mem['memory']})
    processed_memories.add(mem['memory'])
```

#### 3.2 Conversation Flow
1. User input processing
2. Memory search and retrieval
3. Context building
4. AI response generation
5. Memory storage

### 4. Dependencies
- `openai`: For AI model integration
- `mem0`: For memory management
- `python-dotenv`: For environment variable management
- `time`: For conversation pacing

### 5. Setup Requirements
1. Python environment
2. Required API keys:
   - Mem0 API Key
   - Google API Key
3. Environment variables in `.env` file:
   ```
   MEMO_API_KEY=your_memo_api_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

### 6. Usage Guide

#### 6.1 Starting the Bot
```bash
python RecallBot.py
```

#### 6.2 Basic Commands
- Start conversation: Simply type your message
- End session: Type 'quit', 'q', or 'exit'

#### 6.3 Conversation Flow
1. Enter your name for user identification
2. Type messages to interact with the bot
3. Bot will:
   - Search for relevant memories
   - Generate contextual responses
   - Store conversation history

### 7. Security Features
- API key protection through environment variables
- User-specific memory isolation
- Secure memory storage through Mem0

### 9. Performance Considerations
- Memory deduplication for efficient storage
- Context window management
- Response time optimization
- Memory search efficiency

### 10. Error Handling
- API connection errors
- Memory storage failures
- Invalid user inputs
- Environment variable validation

### 11. Best Practices
1. Regular API key rotation
2. Memory cleanup for inactive users
3. Regular backup of conversation history
4. Monitoring of API usage

### 12. Limitations
1. CLI-only interface
2. Single-user focus
3. Limited memory search capabilities
4. No conversation export feature

### 13. Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- API key management
- Memory system optimization
- Performance monitoring

### 14. Conclusion
RecallBot demonstrates the effective integration of AI and memory systems to create a more human-like conversation experience. Its architecture allows for easy expansion and modification while maintaining security and performance standards.
